    # How to push to two git repositry from one repositry ?
    answer : you can add multiple origin to the repositry and push to the sepecific repo by using their origin name.EX we have :
        origin  https://github.com/preetgur/git-sheet.git (fetch)
        origin  https://github.com/preetgur/git-sheet.git (push)
        originlates     https://github.com/preetgur/testing.git (fetch)
        originlates     https://github.com/preetgur/testing.git (push)

        cmd : git push origin main 
              git push originlates dev


# Git branch
    create new branch :
    >> git branch dev

    list branches : 
    >> git branch
    switch branch : 
    >> git checkout master

    To create a new branch and switch to it at the same time :
    >>  git checkout -b master

    merge the hotfix branch back into your master branch :
    >> git checkout master
       git merge hotfix
    
    first you’ll delete the hotfix branch, because you no longer need it — the master branch points at the same place. You can delete it with the -d option to git branch:
    >> git branch -d hotfix

    To see the last commit on each branch, you can run :
    >> git branch -v

    Rename the branch locally with the git branch --move command:
    >> git branch --move bad-branch-name corrected-branch-name

    This replaces your bad-branch-name with corrected-branch-name, but this change is only local for now. To let others see the corrected branch on the remote, push it:

    >> git push --set-upstream origin corrected-branch-name

    Ex: 
        >> git branch --move master main
        >> git push --set-upstream origin main
    
    you can delete the master branch:

    >> git push origin --delete master
